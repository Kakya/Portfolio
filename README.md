This is an identity mapping project I have been working on as part of a larger team. This represents my contributions.
To see this code in action head to kakya.github.io/map
The site will ask for the name of a map, then you create identities by using the add identites button, pressing on a node will let you add a subattribute and, finally, pressing "create graph" will present all created identities into a graph layout that's interactive, you can move stuff around and whatnot.
